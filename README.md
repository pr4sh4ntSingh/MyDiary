# MyDiary

If you are interested in writing Diary but a little bit afraid about privacy.
Here you go. You can make your own password here (or create a dynamic one) to secure your data file.
This app uses sqlite database so no installation of any dependency is needed. 
One more thing, you can also create your own sweet algo for encryption and decryption instead of my wierd ceaser cipher one.
